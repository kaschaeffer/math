\section{Roots of Unity and Cyclotomic Polynomials}

The n\textsuperscript{th} roots of unity are defined as the solutions to the equation
\begin{equation}
\zeta^{n} = 1
\end{equation}

There are n solutions to this equation given by,
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{n, k} = e^{\frac{2 \pi i k}{n}}
\end{equation}

However, notice that some of these are less interesting solutions (for example $ 1 $ is always an n\textsuperscript{th} root of unity for all $n$). We define the \textbf{primitive roots of unity} to be those for which,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\zeta^{k} & \neq 1 \quad \forall k < n \\
\zeta^{n} & = 1
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{Group structure}

The roots of unity form a group since if $a$ and $b$ are both roots of unity, then $(ab)^{n} = 1$. In addition, $1$ is trivially a root of unity. Finally, inverses exist since $\frac{1}{a}$ is clearly also a root of unity.

What is the group structure?

\subsection{Digression: Multiplicative and Additive Groups}

This section is a quick digression for understanding the relationship between additive and multiplicative groups. To start, for prime $ p $, we'll focus on the relationship between the multiplicative group, $ \mathbb{F}_{p}^{\times} $, and the additive group of integers mod $ p - 1 $ which we'll write as $ \mathbb{Z}_{p-1} $

To start we'll write out the simplest nontrivial example of
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{F}_{5}^{x} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{4}
\end{equation}

Being very explicit, it's useful to write out the multiplication table. For $ \mathbb{F}_{5}^{x} $,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{ | c || c | c | c | c |}
\hline
   & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} \\ \hline\hline
\textbf{1} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
\textbf{2} & 2 & 4 & 1 & 3 \\ \hline
\textbf{3} & 3 & 1 & 4 & 2 \\ \hline
\textbf{4} & 1 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

and for $ \mathbb{Z}_{4} $ the addition table,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{ | c || c | c | c | c |}
\hline
   & \textbf{0} & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} \\ \hline\hline
\textbf{0} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline
\textbf{1} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 0 \\ \hline
\textbf{2} & 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
\textbf{3} & 3 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Looking at this table there are mulitple isomorphisms. Either
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
1 & \leftrightarrow 0 \\
2 & \leftrightarrow 1 \\
3 & \leftrightarrow 3 \\
4 & \leftrightarrow 2
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

or 

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
1 & \leftrightarrow 0 \\
2 & \leftrightarrow 3 \\
3 & \leftrightarrow 1 \\
4 & \leftrightarrow 2
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

These correspond respectively to the maps group homomorphisms, $ \mathbb{Z}_{4} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_{5}^{\times} $
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
f_{2}: x & \mapsto 2^{x} \\
f_{3}: x & \mapsto 3^{x}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

More generally we can look at the map, $ \mathbb{Z}_{p-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_{p}^{\times} $, defined by
\begin{equation}
f_{a} : x \mapsto a^{x}
\end{equation}

and verify that it is actually a group homomorphism. We can quickly check that this does not define a homomorphism if $a=0$, so we'll assume $a\neq 0$ for the rest of the discussion.

First we check that it preserves the group operation,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
f_{a}(n)\cdot f_{a}(m) & = a^{n} \cdot a^{m} = a^{n+m} = f(n+m) \quad \qedsymbol
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

We also need to ensure the image of this map is actually in $ \mathbb{F}_{p}^{\times} $ by checking that
\begin{equation}
2^{n} = 0
\end{equation}
has no solutions in $ \mathbb{F}_{p} $. This is obvious since p is prime (ignoring the edge case of $p=2$).

Now that we've established that this is a well-defined homomorphism, we want to now understand when it's an isomorphism. Since both groups are finite, it's enough to check that the map is injective.

Therefore, we want to understand for what values of $ a $ the following equation has nontrivial solutions
\begin{equation}
a^n = 1 \quad \mod p
\end{equation}
where $ 0 \leq n \leq p - 2 $. We know for $a=1$ this equation is true for all values of $n$. Similarly, it's straightforward to see that for $a=-1$ this equation has a nontrival solution when $n=2$. What about other values?

We use the known fact (see Serre for a proof) that $ \mathbb{F}_{p-1}^{\times} $ is cyclic. Suppose we have a generator for $ \mathbb{F}_{p-1}^{\times} $, x (note: there is not deterministic way to quickly find a generator, but there are known polynomial time probabilistic algorithms). Then it's easy to see that for all choices of
\begin{equation}
a = x^{k} \quad s.t. \quad (k, p - 1) = 1
\end{equation}
the map will be an isomorphism. Therefore there are $\phi(p-1)$ distinct isomorphisms.

Phrasing this all in a different way, each isomorphism corresponds to finding a generator for $ \mathbb{F}_{p-1}^{\times} $.

\subsection{Digression Part 2: Non-prime examples}

If p is not prime, we can still look at the multiplicative group - what group is this isomorphic to?

Worked example: $ \mathbb{F}_{10}^{\times} $

NOTE: this is a bad example since it's simple

General case (taken from wikipedia) is that this is \textbf{not} cyclic using Chinese Remainder Theorem
